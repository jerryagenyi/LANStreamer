"The second screenshot (image_a365c7.png) shows a critical detail: the Network Status is N/A, and the IP Address is "No Address." This means DVS isn't talking to your network. Without a network connection, it can't see the audio source (like VLC) or route it to other devices, including itself (which is what FFmpeg is trying to capture)." let e understand. when you have a DVS running on your PC, it is just a sound driver right? it live on the network discvering devices tha are dante enabled either to sendor receive signals (much like NDI protocol - right?). So it means when I run my ffmpeg command like this (ffmpeg -f dshow -i audio="DVS Receive 1-2 (Dante Virtual Soundcard)" -ar 44100 -ac 2 -b:a 128k -f mp3 icecast://source:hackme@localhost:8000/stream.mp3) targetting a device point at DVS 1-2 , is it trying to fetch any sound sent to that mount point? or it is trying to send signal to it? i think it is trying to retrieve any sound signal sent to DVS 1-2 soundcard and take that to send to an icecast mount point, and as I understand the mount point is automatically created by the command right? and then I end that session, the mount point on icecast dies right? meaning I need to run the command every time right? so where does my microphone setup for the language translators come in? i am getting confused
