Thanks for the thoughtful feedback, Jeremiah — it’s clear you’re building LANStreamer with the same clarity and modularity you bring to your systems work. Let’s refine the logo direction and build a prompt that aligns with your design philosophy and technical audience.

## 🎯 Logo Goals (Refined)

- **Minimalist & Recognizable**: Clear iconography that immediately suggests LAN + audio streaming.
- **Dark Theme Compatibility**: Designed to pop against a dark grey (#1a1a1d) background.
- **Professional & Accessible**: Clean lines, modern typography, and intuitive symbolism.
- **Modular Identity**: Should scale well across dashboard UI, QR codes, splash screens, and GitHub README badges.

## 🎨 Color Feedback

Your palette is spot-on for a network tool aesthetic. Here's how it could translate into the logo:

| Element              | Suggested Color     | Purpose                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Background           | `#1a1a1d` (Dark Grey) | Base canvas for contrast                 |
| Primary Icon/Accent  | `#007bff` (Tech Blue) | Main logo color for recognizability      |
| Status Indicators    | Green/Red/Yellow     | Optional micro-icons or badges           |
| Typography           | White or Light Grey  | High contrast against dark background    |

## 🧠 Logo Prompt for Designers or AI Tools

Here’s a detailed prompt you can use with a designer or image generation tool:

> **Design a minimalist logo for “LANStreamer”, a desktop app that turns a Windows PC into a local audio streaming server.**  
> The logo should feature:
> - A clean, modern icon that combines **LAN/networking** and **audio streaming** concepts.
> - Icon ideas: stylized speaker emitting waves that resemble a network diagram or signal bars; or a simplified router with audio waveforms.
> - Typography: Use a bold, sans-serif font like Inter or Roboto. “LAN” can be uppercase, “Streamer” can be title case or lowercase.
> - Color palette: Tech-inspired blue (#007bff) for the icon and text, placed on a dark grey background (#1a1a1d).
> - Style: Flat design, no gradients, slightly rounded corners (8px radius), optimized for UI integration.
> - Optional: Include a compact version of the logo (icon-only) for use in QR codes or favicon.

## 🔄 Alternate Logo Concepts You Might Explore

Here are three directions we could iterate on:

1. **Signal Node Icon**  
   - A central dot with radiating arcs or bars, resembling both Wi-Fi and audio waves.
   - Suggests local broadcast and LAN reach.

2. **Modular Blocks**  
   - Three stacked rectangles with subtle waveforms inside, hinting at multiple audio channels.
   - Evokes modularity and stream control.

3. **Router + Speaker Hybrid**  
   - A stylized router silhouette with a speaker cone embedded.
   - Directly communicates LAN + audio.

Would you like me to generate one of these alternate versions now? Or we could explore a few side-by-side and refine from there.
