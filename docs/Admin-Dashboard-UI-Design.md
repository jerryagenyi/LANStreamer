# LANStreamer: Admin Dashboard UI Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design specifications for the LANStreamer admin dashboard interface. The dashboard should provide comprehensive control over audio streaming services with real-time status monitoring, device management, and stream configuration capabilities.

## 1. Header & Status Indicators

The header should contain the LANStreamer logo on the left and four critical status indicators on the right that provide at-a-glance system health monitoring:

### Status Indicators (Left to Right)

1. **FFmpeg Status** üéµ
   - üü¢ **Green**: FFmpeg processes running successfully
   - üî¥ **Red**: FFmpeg not running or processes failed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: FFmpeg installed but not currently active

2. **Icecast Status** üì°
   - üü¢ **Green**: Icecast server running and accessible
   - üî¥ **Red**: Icecast server not running or unreachable
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Icecast installed but not started

3. **Audio Devices Status** üé§
   - üü¢ **Green**: Audio devices detected and available
   - üî¥ **Red**: No audio devices found or detection failed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Limited devices available or permission issues

4. **Network Status** üåê
   - üü¢ **Green**: Network accessible, streams reachable by clients
   - üî¥ **Red**: Network issues, streams not accessible
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yellow**: Limited connectivity or port conflicts

Each indicator should display tooltips on hover with detailed status information and timestamps of last status check. 

**üîó Interactive Design**: Status indicators should be **clickable**, acting as shortcuts to their respective detailed panels further down the page. This creates a seamless user experience by providing both high-level overview and direct access to detailed troubleshooting information.

## 2. Global Settings
### Configuration Management
For a professional application, saving settings in a `.env` file is best for development, but not for a user-updatable dashboard. The best practice is to store user-configurable settings in a **JSON or YAML configuration file** (e.g., `config.json`). This file is read by the application on startup, and the admin dashboard's UI fields write updates back to it. This approach decouples the application's configuration from its deployment environment.

### Default Port
A dedicated input field for the default port is a great idea. It should be a **required field** and perform validation to ensure it's a valid port number. This value would be saved to the `config.json` file.

### Other Settings

#### Default Streaming Format/Codec
Options to select the audio codec (`.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.aac`) and bitrate (`64kbps`, `128kbps`, `192kbps`). These settings will be applied to all new streams unless overridden.

#### Stream Password
An input field to set a global password for all streams on the Icecast server to prevent unauthorised access.

#### Startup Behaviour
A toggle to choose whether streams should automatically start on application launch.

## 3. Dependencies & Status

This section is crucial for user confidence and troubleshooting. The UI should have clear, real-time status indicators beyond the header indicators.

**üîó Integration with Header**: To prevent redundancy and keep the initial view clean, these detailed panels should be **expandable sections** that open when the corresponding header indicator is clicked. This creates a seamless connection between high-level status and detailed diagnostics.

### Detailed Service Sections

#### Icecast & FFmpeg Status Panels

##### Presence Check
The UI should display a clear status indicator (e.g., a green checkmark or a red "X" icon with a tooltip) for whether each dependency is installed and found on the system's `PATH`. If not, a link to a separate `Dependencies-Setup.md` document should be provided.

##### Running Status
Below the presence check, a status indicator should show if the process is currently running. A toggle switch or a dedicated "Start/Stop" button is ideal.

##### Process Log
A dedicated window or collapsible section to display the real-time logs from the Icecast and FFmpeg processes. This is invaluable for debugging and monitoring stream health.

## 4. Audio Devices & Streams
This will be the main, dynamic part of the dashboard.

### Global Refresh
A **"Refresh Audio Devices"** button is a great feature. It should trigger an API call to re-scan the system and update the list. The UI should show a loading state while this happens.

### Default Stream Configuration

- **Device Selection**: A single dropdown to select the default audio input device
- **Stream Naming**: A label or input field to name this stream (e.g., "Main Stage Audio")
- **Controls**: A start/stop button or toggle switch that updates in real-time
- **Status Indicator**: A real-time status indicator (e.g., "Offline", "Starting...", "Live")

### Additional Streams

#### Stream Creation
- A clear, prominent button or section titled **"Add New Language Stream"**
- Clicking this would reveal a form with two dropdowns: one for the audio input device and another for the language
- Once a new stream is added, it should appear as a new, collapsible section on the dashboard with its own name, start/stop button, and status indicator

#### Device Memory
As you mentioned, each stream's configuration (language, device ID) should be saved so it's remembered on next launch. If a saved device is not found, its name should be displayed in **red** with a clear tooltip explaining the status (e.g., "Device not found. Please select a new one.").

#### Global Controls
Buttons to **"Start All Streams"** and **"Stop All Streams"** are essential for ease of use.

## 5. Video Streaming (Future Feature)
### Placeholder UI
As per the Product Requirements Document (PRD), video is a feature for vNext. The UI should have a placeholder or a section clearly labelled as **"Video Streams"** with a **"Coming Soon"** message to manage user expectations.

## 6. UI/UX & Feedback

### Clear Layout
The dashboard should be designed in a clean, sectioned layout, possibly with collapsible panels for each major component (Global Settings, Audio Streams, etc.). This prevents information overload.

### Notifications
Implement a simple notification system to give the user feedback on actions (e.g., "Stream started successfully", "Failed to start stream: port already in use").

### Loading States
All interactive elements that trigger an API call (e.g., refresh button, start stream button) should show a loading indicator to let the user know that the system is processing their request.

## 7. Footer

### Essential Links
The footer should contain links to the project's key documents and external resources for the user:

- **"README"**: Links to the main `README.md` for project overview
- **"Contribute"**: Links to a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (which we can create later) outlining how to contribute to the project
- **"Donate"**: A link to a PayPal donation page, as you specified

## 9. Implementation Guidelines

### Interactive Behaviors

#### Clickable Header Indicators
- **Purpose**: Provide shortcuts from high-level status to detailed diagnostics
- **Behavior**: Clicking a header indicator scrolls to and expands the corresponding detailed panel
- **Visual Feedback**: Subtle animation (300ms ease-in-out) when transitioning to detail view
- **State Management**: Only one detailed panel should be expanded at a time to maintain focus

#### Responsive Design Priorities
1. **Mobile First**: Ensure core functionality works on mobile devices
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add desktop-specific features like multi-column layouts
3. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile compatibility
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements

#### Performance Considerations
- **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSocket connections for live status updates
- **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed panels only when accessed
- **Efficient Polling**: Intelligent polling rates based on user activity
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Development Notes
This design document provides a comprehensive blueprint that balances:
- **Professional aesthetics** with functional requirements
- **High-level overview** with detailed diagnostic capabilities  
- **Clean initial presentation** with comprehensive feature access
- **Desktop experience** with mobile responsiveness

The clickable header indicators and expandable detail panels create a **seamless user flow** that prevents information overload while maintaining full functionality access.
