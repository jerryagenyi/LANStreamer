# LANStreamer User Guides

> **Simple, step-by-step guides for non-technical users**

## 📦 Required Software Installation

**Before using LANStreamer, you need to install these two programs:**

### Essential Components
- **[FFmpeg Installation](./ffmpeg-installation.md)** - Audio processor (5 minutes) ⭐ **Start here**
- **[Icecast Installation](./icecast-installation.md)** - Streaming server (5 minutes)

> **💡 Why do I need these?** LANStreamer is a web application that coordinates these two powerful tools to create your streaming server. Think of LANStreamer as the "control panel" and FFmpeg/Icecast as the "engines" that do the actual work.
