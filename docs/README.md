# LANStreamer Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the LANStreamer project.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
2. **Configure environment:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed
3. **Start development server:**
   - **With live reload:** `npm run dev:live` ‚Üí `http://localhost:3002` ‚ö°
   - **Regular mode:** `npm run dev` ‚Üí `http://localhost:3001`
4. **Access dashboard:** Add `/dashboard` to either URL

### üîÑ Development Mode

For the best development experience, use `npm run dev:live`:
- **Auto-refresh** on file changes (no more manual refresh!)
- **BrowserSync** dashboard for development tools
- **Multi-device testing** support
- **Network access** for testing on other devices
