## Development Workflow

This project follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach:

1. **Red Phase** - Write failing tests first
2. **Green Phase** - Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase** - Clean up and improve code quality

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Steps 1-5)
- Backend core server and health check
- Audio device service (mocked)
- Audio device API endpoint
- FFmpeg process management (simulated)
- Stream control API endpoints
- Comprehensive test coverage (9/9 backend tests passing)

### üîÑ In Progress (Step 6)
- Frontend admin dashboard
- Vue.js components and routing
- Vuex store management
- User interface implementation

### ‚è≥ Pending (Step 7)
- Final integration with real FFmpeg/Icecast
- End-to-end testing with Playwright
- Production deployment preparation

## Getting Started

1. Review the **PRD** to understand project goals
2. Follow the **TDD Plan** for development workflow
