    feat: Integrate Firebase Studio and Fix Icecast Config
    
    This commit introduces significant new files related to Google Firebase Studio and provides a critical fix for the Icecast server integration.
    
    ### New Files (Firebase Studio)
    
    - `firebase.json`: The core configuration file for Firebase projects. It defines rules for deployment, Cloud Functions, Hosting, and other Firebase services. This file tells the Firebase CLI how to interact with the project.
    
    - `.firebaserc`: This file stores project-specific settings, such as the default Firebase project to be used. It helps streamline CLI commands by associating the local directory with a specific Firebase project.
    
    - `storage.rules`: Defines the security rules for Firebase Cloud Storage. This is a critical security file that dictates who can read, write, update, and delete files stored in your storage buckets, preventing unauthorized access.
    
    ### Fixes
    
    - **Fix(Icecast):** Corrected the `icecast.xml` configuration to use absolute paths for `<logdir>`, `<webroot>`, and `<adminroot>`.
    
    - **Reasoning:** The Icecast server was failing to start because it was launched from the Node.js application's working directory, not the Icecast installation directory. This caused it to be unable to find the relative `log` directory, leading to a fatal crash on startup. Using absolute paths ensures that Icecast can always locate its required directories, regardless of the execution context.
    
    ### Other Changes
    
    - `config/icecast.xml`: A new, corrected version of the Icecast configuration file has been added to the repository. This allows for consistent and reliable server startups across different development environments and will be used to replace the problematic local configuration.
