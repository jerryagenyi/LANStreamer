# LANStreamer Development TODO List

## 🚨 URGENT TASKS

### 🔧 Button Refactoring Issue (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] **Fix Icecast Component Breakdown**
  - [x] Component shows "Component Not Available" after refactoring attempt
  - [x] Need to properly revert to working state from main branch
  - [x] Button refactoring approach needs revision - separate button component caused initialization issues
  - [x] Consider alternative solutions for button state management that don't break component loading
  - [x] Test thoroughly before attempting refactoring again

### 🚨 Restart Button Fix (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Fix restart button false success message**
  - [x] Server stops but doesn't restart properly
  - [x] Frontend shows "success" before verifying restart worked
  - [x] Backend restart method now verifies server actually started
  - [x] Frontend checks actual server status before showing success
  - [x] Added warning notification type for partial failures
  - [x] **Increased wait times** - Backend start wait: 3s → 8s, restart shutdown wait: 3s → 5s, force kill wait: 2s → 3s
  - [x] **Frontend restart wait** - Increased from 6s to 12s to match backend timing
  - [x] **Enhanced logging** - Added detailed failure logging in restart method

### 🚨 Button State Race Condition Fix (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Fix button state updates before operations complete**
  - [x] Buttons updating state immediately without waiting for server operations
  - [x] Race conditions allowing users to click buttons before operations complete
  - [x] **Status verification before operations** - All buttons now check current server status before acting
  - [x] **Wait for completion** - Buttons wait for actual server state changes before updating UI
  - [x] **Prevent race conditions** - All buttons disabled during any operation to prevent multiple clicks
  - [x] **Enhanced error handling** - Re-check status on errors to ensure UI accuracy
