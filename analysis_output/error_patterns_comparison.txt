== v1.2.0 (no errorDiagnostics.js) ==
== v1.2.2 (no errorDiagnostics.js) ==
== v1.2.3 (no errorDiagnostics.js) ==
== HEAD (has errorDiagnostics.js - added post-v1.2.3) ==

CRITICAL FINDING: errorDiagnostics.js was introduced AFTER v1.2.3
Therefore, it cannot be the cause of regression from v1.2.0 to v1.2.3
