# LANStreamer Development Documentation (Isolated Branch)

## üîí **Branch Purpose: Complete Isolation**

This is the **`dev-docs-isolated`** branch - a true **orphan branch** with **no shared history** with the main codebase. This branch contains **only** internal development documentation, specifications, and resources for LANStreamer.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Why Isolated?**

- **No Accidental Merges**: Git will refuse to merge this branch into main without explicit `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag
- **Clean Main Branch**: Keeps the main branch free of internal development files for public release
- **Complete Separation**: Development documentation lives independently from production code
- **Safe Experimentation**: Can modify, reorganize, or restructure documentation without affecting main codebase

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **This branch has NO shared history with main** - it's completely isolated
- **Cannot be accidentally merged** into main branch
- **Only contains development documentation** - no production code
- **Safe to delete/recreate** without affecting main codebase
- **Independent versioning** from main branch releases

## üéØ Purpose

This isolated documentation branch serves multiple purposes:

1. **Technical Reference** - Detailed specifications and architectural decisions
2. **Development Guides** - Step-by-step tutorials for complex implementations
3. **Testing Framework** - Comprehensive test suites for quality assurance
4. **Project Planning** - Requirements, roadmaps, and design decisions (TODO.md)
5. **Knowledge Sharing** - Blog posts and articles about the development process
6. **Internal Resources** - Development files not suitable for public main branch

## üöÄ Getting Started

For developers working on LANStreamer:

1. **Switch to this branch**: `git checkout dev-docs-isolated`
2. **Start with the PRD** (`specifications/LANStreamer-PRD.md`) to understand the product vision
3. **Review the TDD** (`specifications/LANStreamer-TDD.md`) for technical architecture
4. **Check TODO.md** for current development priorities and roadmap
5. **Follow the Technical Walkthrough** (`tutorials/LANStreamer-Complete-Technical-Walkthrough.md`) for implementation details
6. **Run the tests** in `/tests/` to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

## üìã Contributing

When adding new documentation:

- **Specifications** go in `/specifications/`
- **Tests** go in the appropriate `/tests/` subdirectory
- **Tutorials and guides** go in `/tutorials/`
- **Planning documents** go in `/planning/`
- **Blog posts** go in `/blog/`
- **Development tasks** go in `TODO.md`

Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes and follow the established naming conventions.

## üîÑ Branch Management

### **Working with the Isolated Branch**

```bash
# Switch to isolated documentation branch
git checkout dev-docs-isolated

# Make documentation changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update development documentation"
git push

# Switch back to main for code work
git checkout main
```

### **Safety Features**

- **Merge Protection**: Git will show error if you try to merge into main
- **No Contamination**: Changes here cannot accidentally affect production code
- **Independent History**: This branch has its own commit history separate from main
- **Safe Deletion**: Can be deleted and recreated without affecting main branch

**This branch represents the complete internal development knowledge base for LANStreamer, safely isolated from the production codebase.**
