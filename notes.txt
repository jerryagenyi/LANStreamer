Current Status Summary
✅ What's Working:
Frontend Dynamic Rendering: The frontend now properly calls renderAudioDevices() and will show dynamic content instead of static
API Endpoints: All audio device API endpoints are working
FFmpeg Command Execution: FFmpeg is running and producing output (4709 characters)
Fallback System: System gracefully falls back to default devices when detection fails
❌ What's Still Not Working:
FFmpeg Device Parsing: The regex pattern isn't matching the actual FFmpeg output format
Real Device Detection: Still getting fallback devices instead of your real 3 microphones
🔧 The Issue:
The FFmpeg command is working and producing output, but our regex pattern \[dshow @ .*\] "([^"]+)" \(audio\) isn't matching the actual output format.
